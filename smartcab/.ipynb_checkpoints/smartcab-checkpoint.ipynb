In this notebook, template code has already been provided for you to aid in your analysis of the *Smartcab* and your implemented learning algorithm. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. There will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and the visualizations provided in the notebook. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a *Smartcab* through its environment towards a goal. Since the *Smartcab* is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: **Safety** and **Reliability**. A driving agent that gets the *Smartcab* to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered **unsafe**. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered **unreliable**. Maximizing the driving agent's **safety** and **reliability** would ensure that *Smartcabs* have a permanent place in the transportation industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety** and **Reliability** are measured using a letter-grade system as follows:\n",

    "|   A+  \t|  Agent commits no traffic violations,<br/>and always chooses the correct action. | Agent reaches the destination in time<br />for 100% of trips. |\n",
    "|   A   \t|  Agent commits few minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 90% of trips. |\n",
    "|   B   \t| Agent commits frequent minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 80% of trips. |\n",
    "|   C   \t|  Agent commits at least one major traffic violation,<br/> such as driving through a red light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 70% of trips. |\n",
    "|   D   \t| Agent causes at least one minor accident,<br/> such as turning left on green with oncoming traffic.       \t| Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",
    "|   F   \t|  Agent causes at least one major accident,<br />such as driving through a red light with cross-traffic.      \t| Agent fails to reach the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |\n",

When the light is red 25% of the actions are correct, when the light is green 75% of actions are possible. They may still cause accidents with oncoming traffic when it is turning left or right (according to the console logs).<br/>\n",

We can confirm this from the individual rewards in the console logs. The major accidents are penalized very heavily (e.g. -39.29) and also for small rewards (e.g. -19.59). For minor infractions, the reward is about -4.93 ( average). Occasionally, the positive reward is also seen (e.g. 2.52), higher if it drives towards waypoints.\n",

Then, when the agent encounters a state and performs an action, update the Q-value associated with that state-action pair based on the reward received and the interative update rule implemented. Of course, additional benefits come from Q-Learning, such that we can have the agent choose the *best* action for each state based on the Q-values of each state-action pair possible. For this project, you will be implementing a *decaying,* $\\epsilon$*-greedy* Q-learning algorithm with *no* discount factor. Follow the implementation instructions under each **TODO** in the agent functions.\n",

    "## Improve the Q-Learning Driving Agent\n",
    "The third step to creating an optimized Q-Learning agent is to perform the optimization! Now that the Q-Learning algorithm is implemented and the driving agent is successfully learning, it's necessary to tune settings and adjust learning paramaters so the driving agent learns both **safety** and **efficiency**. Typically this step will require a lot of trial and error, as some settings will invariably make the learning worse. One thing to keep in mind is the act of learning itself and the time that this takes: In theory, we could allow the agent to learn for an incredibly long amount of time; however, another goal of Q-Learning is to *transition from experimenting with unlearned behavior to acting on learned behavior*. For example, always allowing the agent to perform a random action during training (if $\\epsilon = 1$ and never decays) will certainly make it *learn*, but never let it *act*. When improving on your Q-Learning implementation, consider the impliciations it creates and whether it is logistically sensible to make a particular adjustment."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "a)  My intuition in selecting this was we need a good exploration of states & actions to get different combinations. This gave good coverage for initial safety values.  But in the exploitation, we need enough time select actions with higher rewards. That is, our reliability will be hiher if we reach the destination faster in the trial. Safety increases along with reliability in the exploitation phase.  I tried multiple functions (cosine, 1-sine, increase in rate of decay, etc. totalling to about 25 different trials) Finally, I decided to use a combination linear decay, first until 10 trials decays slowly and then decays faster. <br/>\n",
    "b) Based on the need for more trials identified in the state space question I aimed at about 200 trials. I updated the line functions in a way to achieve this. (100 steps of 0.002 & then 100 steps of 0.008) <br/>\n",
    "c) My epsilon tolerance was 0.025. Initially I tried different options like threshold like 0.2. But I realized that the learning needs to spend a large time exploiting to increase both reliability & safety. <br/>\n",
    "d) Improvement was considerable. Compared to the default learner, the final total number of bad actions decreased from about 0.13 in default to 0.04, the final average reward increased from 0.2 to 1.2. Safety & Reliability increased from B & D rating to A+ & B.<br/>\n",
    "e) Yes.  We can see that the average reward function increases as the trials progress.  The total number of actions also decreases. The bad actions causing both minor and major violation and accidents increases. This means that the learner is able to learn the right policy. I discuss on the reliability below. <br/>\n",
    "f) Yes, after spending 8 hours with different combinations, I was able to get A+ & B Safety & Reliability rating. I had to change the alpha value as well to reach these goals. After different trials I was able to finalize an alpha with a decay. This means in the exploration phase, the learning steps is large, but reduces as we switch to exploitation. I was hoping to get better reliability, but this seemed the best for now."

    "### Define an Optimal Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the answer to the important question *\"what am I trying to get my agent to learn?\"* only has a theoretical answer and cannot be concretely described. Here, however, you can concretely define what it is the agent is trying to learn, and that is the U.S. right-of-way traffic laws. Since these laws are known information, you can further define, for each state the *Smartcab* is occupying, the optimal action for the driving agent based on these laws. In that case, we call the set of optimal state-action pairs an **optimal policy**. Hence, unlike some theoretical answers, it is clear whether the agent is acting \"incorrectly\" not only by the reward (penalty) it receives, but also by pure observation. If the agent drives through a red light, we both see it receive a negative reward but also know that it is not the correct behavior. This can be used to your advantage for verifying whether the **policy** your driving agent has learned is the correct one, or if it is a **suboptimal policy**."

Essentially, if the driving agent is given the option to make several actions to arrive at different states, including future rewards will bias the agent towards states that could provide even more rewards. An example of this would be the driving agent moving towards a goal: With all actions and rewards equal, moving towards the goal would theoretically yield better rewards if there is an additional reward for reaching the goal. However, even though in this project, the driving agent is trying to reach a destination in the allotted time, including future rewards will not benefit the agent.
