    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

Because of this, *UdacityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would is appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *UdacityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *UdacityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "- **Weaknesses: ** Two major weaknesses of random forests are - succeptible to overfitting to training data, and the model is difficult to interpret.\n",
    "- **Why good candidate: ** Intuitively, income seems to have an almost rule-like dependence on education level and occupation (as many positions in the industry are hired based on rules.) Initially, I started with a decision tree, since they are able to identify rules very well. Since the RandomForest ensamble method is superior to a decesion tre in that it creates a multiple of decision trees and returns the mode classification, I chose Random forests to allow different hypotheses to exist on the data. \n",

    "**clf_b) SVM**\n",
    "- **Real world application: ** Text classification (e.g. sentiment analysis) problem deals with a very large number of features, which are sparse and only few of which may be irrelevant. In such a setting SVMs perform really well because of their nature to handle high dimensionality, sparse and consider as many features as possible. SVMs in particular can identify unique complex concepts which are typical in classification tasks like sentiment analysis [3] \n",
    "- **Strengths: ** SVMs can identify complex decision boundaries in linear as well as non-linear data-sets as a result of non-linear kernals with the help of the kernel trick. \n",
    "- **Weaknesses: ** SVMs can be really slow for training and testing if the size of the data is large (as seen by results of the experiments)\n",
    "- **Why good candidate: ** Since the SVC implementation uses rbf kernel as the default and can find a decision boundry even for even non-linear data, I thought that it is a good candidate for our data, where the data may be non-linearly related like country, marital status, etc.\n",

    "**clf_c) Logistic Regression Classifier**\n",
    "- **Real world application: ** Intuitively, logistic regression predicts the (log) odds likelihood ratio of a particular class. A popular application is to predict if a person will vote Republican or Democrat (e.g. in exit polls) [4]\n",
    "- **Strengths: ** Logistic regression is robust (the independent variables donâ€™t have to be normally distributed, or have equal variance in each group) and does not overfit as bad as decision trees. Logistic Regression can handle corelated features.\n",
    "- **Weakness: ** However, it may need a large amount of data to fit the right function to achive useful performance.\n",
    "- **Why good cangidate** Our target feature income > 50000 can have values True OR False. Since logistic regression is good for such kind of feature prediction, I prefered  Logistic regression. This is because logistic regression assumes a Bernoulli Distribution for the conditional probability and performs better. The output can be interpreted as the cofidence of the prediction as well, because of which it is useful for the donor domain.\n",

    "**Answer: ** Our goal is to determine if a person earns more than 50K when we only know attributes for that person, like age, gender, marital status, occupation, country of origin, etc. The model chosen calculates if the person is likely to have income greater than 50K or not. That is, it tells us what is the chance that that person earns more than 50K$, and if the chance that he earns more than 50K is more than the chance that he doesn't, the model predicts that his income is greater than 50K.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works. We took about 36177 people from the data you already gave us. For these people we knew if they earned >50K. Now we also had those attributes like age, gender, occupation, etc. From the 36177 people, the model decided to create its own internal points system. It also identified attributes more important than others, by giving them more/less weightage. For example, if the person has a masters degree, and since he earns more than 50K, he should get higher points if you have a masters degree. Maybe the fact that the person is from Taiwan doesn't really matter so e dont give as many points. Similarly, people who don't earn 50K$ were given lower points for their atttributes. The model also calculated the odds of the person earning more than 50K such that the higher the points, the more higher his odds of earning >50K.   \n",

    "So now, for a person you have not got in your data, if you want to predict wether she earns >50K, you feed their attributes to the model. The model will give them points based on those attributes, giving more points for those important attributes. Finally, if the points is large, it will give it more odds that she earns >50K. And if the odds that she earns >50K are greater than the odds she earns < 50K, then it predicts her as a high income person, who is, for you, a potential donor."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower â€” at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
